# Algos_bonus

It is required to have python version 3 to run this program.
You can run this program in the command line using:
$python .\puzzle.py 1 4 2 _ 3 5 6 7 8

Goal state is fixed: _ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The program finds the steps of the puzzle for the predefinded goal, using two heuristics.
H1- manhattan distances
H2- constant value 0
