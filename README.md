# Algos_bonus

It is required to have python version 3 to run this program. Both files must be in the same directory.

You can run this bash script in the command line using (8 arguments separated by a space):
$.\puzzle.sh 1 4 2 _ 3 5 6 7 8

Goal state is fixed: _ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The program finds the steps of the puzzle for the predefinded goal, using two heuristics.
H1- manhattan distances
H2- constant value 0
